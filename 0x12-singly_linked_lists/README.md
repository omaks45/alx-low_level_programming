Task 0 Print list
Function prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);                                                                                 
x is being declared which is used to store the value of the elements.                                                                   
firstly I had to loop through while head is not equal to null and I had to check also if h is pointing to string and equal to null had to print 0 and nil
then else  I had to check if h pointing to string and not equal to null then I had to print h pointing to len and h pointing to string 
and had to assign head to point to next and increment x as well as printing x.
